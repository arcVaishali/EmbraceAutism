          I was diagnosed with autism at a young age, and it presented unique challenges in my childhood. However, my journey through art has allowed me to express myself in ways words couldn't. Each brushstroke and color choice tells a story of my emotions, thoughts, and experiences. Through art, I found a language that transcends barriers, and I'm excited to share my journey with you at the Artistic Spectrum Exhibition.
